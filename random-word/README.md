## How to run
#### NOOOOOOO what are you doing?????? This ain't your browser html, this is node.js.
This app uses [electronjs](https://electronjs.org/), to run html that supports Node Js. Oh yeah! So to run this go to the parent directory of the repository and then run these commands: Same for Windows, Mac and Linux:
```
cd random-words 
npm i electron --save
npm install
```
The above code will prepare all the files, and then you will ahve to run:
`npm start`
and voila!
